# project
The site consists of 6 blocks, the first and sixth are the site header and the end of the site, there are links to different parts of the site itself, the second and fourth are text data for which the site's functionality is needed. The third is a calculator that calculates the rate of your calories per day depending on your weight. And the fifth block of the site is a database with the most popular products that displays their calorie content.


The project does not focus on any particular programming language, the idea was to master the brevity of languages and their interaction with each other.
